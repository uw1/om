[Anxiety Is in Your Body, Not Your Mind | by Emma Pattee | Apr, 2021 | Elemental](https://elemental.medium.com/anxiety-is-in-your-body-not-your-mind-93031abd14eb)
	When your body is having a stress response, the first thing is to become aware of objects that help the survival brain feel safe, like what you can see and hear. “One of the best ways to help the survival brain feel grounded is to bring attention to where our body is in contact with our environment,” Stanley says. She suggests focusing on the contact between your feet with the floor, or your body in your chair. As soon as the survival brain perceives groundedness and safety, it automatically starts the recovery process.
	Obviously, when you’re caught in a moment of severe anxiety, trying to breathe deeply or be mindful can feel almost impossible. In those situations, what you need is to get the adrenaline and cortisol out of your system. Stanley suggests jumping rope or running up and down stairs. After 10 minutes, try a mindfulness exercise again.

# 真娱乐
智商剧对于我来说太一样/普通，所以没有娱乐度
不认同，没有带入感，也没有娱乐度
# cascade
hormone之间是连锁反应，不是简单的快乐/痛苦
单一hormone越多不代表越好
# 娱乐意义
power, 坚持下去的动力
面对逆境的力量
娱乐本质是时间代价的快乐药
# 假娱乐
面对逆境的误导，distract
	开挂/作弊
精神肥胖
只是能够引起你的注意但是并不能给你带来快乐
	如果没有刻意防备的话。很容易就被吸引进去。浪费一大把时间却什么都没得到，甚至心情还更差了。
玩完游戏更焦虑了

Almost all big tech companies employ droves of psychologists and clever product designers trying to [make sure that their product is more attention grabbing than the next company’s](https://writingcooperative.com/our-evolving-interaction-with-technology-b24e4d440b08), gets us to engage more often with their app, or makes us return more and more frequently to their website.
