[[不垃圾的编程语言]]
大部分程序员的智商都非常有限, 无法编写和理解复杂代码。Lisp这种这种需要元思维能力的编程语言注定无法流行起来。

# 道
最好的东西从来就没有一个固定的形式，而是像水一样可以变成不同的形式。
一开始做的太好没有意义，一是过于费力，二是暴露创意，三是你认为的更好并不一定真的是更好。
我们需要的是一个不固定可以改变的编程语言，而不是无数种各种各样乱七八糟的编程语言

# separating syntax and semantics
[I have yet to check it out, but it's very cool when people try to rethink SQL, a... | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26805541)
	if you're creating a new programming language, consider making syntax and semantics separate in the specification. Lots of people get hung up on arguing about language syntax but it's really semantics differences that are important for compatibility. Lot of new languages comes up only to fix syntactic problems with existing languages but create small semantic differences in the process, making automated translation from and to existing languages difficult. I wish we could move to a world where syntax and semantics in programming languages are discussed separately from each other.

[Latino Programming Language | Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26805011)
	I started learning programming before I could speak English well. A programming language using English words isn't a barrier in any way. Those words aren't real English words, they are symbols. Instead of "and" you could very well have "/\\" and it wouldn't make the slightest difference. As a non-English programmer you don't think of those as words, just symbols. And that's accidentally closer to the truth and probably even moulds your mind into a shape better suited for such an abstract task. Using "if" and "else" neither requires, nor is made easier by knowledge of what those words mean. (At the time when I learnt it, I knew what "if" meant, but not what "else" did. It didn't bother me in the slightest.)

Half of these are anti patterns that I appreciate other languages (Go, Rust) leave out (non-virtual inheritance, singletons, ...). Elena announcing them as features makes me wary.

	everything is a function that takes a [stack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stack_(data_structure) "Stack (data structure)") as an argument and returns a stack as a result. For instance, the numeral '5' does not represent an integer constant, but instead a short program that pushes the number 5 onto the stack.
